                        <p>This was a remote internship during the COVID-19 pandemic where I was a member of the 3D Outbound team in the supply chain division. Here, I modernized legacy supply chain SQL procedures to Java Spring Boot services. Additionally, I built, deployed, and maintained a centralized, ReactJS search interface that allowed teams to more efficiently track the movement of products in distribution centers. My internship was extended throughout the school semester, and during this time I resolved external data access issues by engineering Kotlin Spring Boot microservices for other teams to access supply chain Oracle databases.</p>
