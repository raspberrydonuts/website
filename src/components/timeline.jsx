                        <p>I was on the Fixed Income Technology in the Asset Management division. My main deliverable was a dashboard that visualized real-time market trends for fixed income securities. With billions of ticks of market data coming in every day from multiple vendors, traders needed a way to quickly see movements in the market in order to optimize portfolios and monitor risk. I worked with my co-intern to create a dynamic, customizable, and actionable visualization tool that the traders could utilize to aggregate the market data on a sector level and quickly identify market trends. Along with this implementation, we migrated other portfolio management functionalities into a centralized platform in order to save traders countless hours of sourcing liquidity data. Most of my work was built using Scala, Java, and Angular.</p>

                        <p>This was a remote internship during the COVID-19 pandemic where I was a member of the 3D Outbound team in the supply chain division. Here, I modernized legacy supply chain SQL procedures to Java Spring Boot services. Additionally, I built, deployed, and maintained a centralized, ReactJS search interface that allowed teams to more efficiently track the movement of products in distribution centers. My internship was extended throughout the school semester, and during this time I resolved external data access issues by engineering Kotlin Spring Boot microservices for other teams to access supply chain Oracle databases.</p>
